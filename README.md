# Python Challenge

## Overview
This project has two components:
1. PyBank analyzes financial records of an unnamed company. Run main.py and the results will export to a text file in the analysis folder.
2. PyPoll analyzes the election data of a small town. Run main.py and the results will export to a text file in the analysis folder.

## External support
I used the starter code provided by the bootcamp.

## Note re. PyPoll: 
I set a stopping point in the code after creating the "candidates" list. Because it only returns three candidates -- namely, Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, & Raymon Anthony Doane -- I chose to simply tackle these three individually. (If there were more than four candidates, a lot of write-ins, etc., I would have to solve this differently.)
